<h3>What I Did This Summer</h3>
<p> I spent most of this summer doing quantum mechanics research at George Washington University, from around 10AM to 4PM every weekday. After work, I would go to track practice with the Special Forces Track Club in Loudoun County. I would get home exhausted at around 9, or 9:30 every night, so I'd just watch How I Met Your Mother. I actually finished all nine seasons this summer, but in retrospect there were probably better ways to spend my time.  </p>

<h3>Other Stuff</h3>
<p> This summer, the World Championships of Track and Field were held in Beijing, China, and my man Usain Bolt won the 100m and 200m races.<br><br>
If you aren't interested in track, and maybe in football instead, you can go ahead and skip ahead to that <a href="myPage.htm#football"> section</a>.

By the way, this image was put in a span.

<p> On the other hand, this other image of Usain is in a div. </p>

<div><img src="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150823143306-usain-bolt-wins-beijing-large-169.jpg" width = "480" height = "240" /></div>

<pre>See how the text isn't next to the image this time?</pre>

<p>Also you might've noticed the last sentence's font was monospaced. That's done with &ltpre&gt. Also, character entities were used to display those less than and greater than signs.</p>

<p> Another big event this summer is the US Open for tennis. The top seeds going into this year's open included (in order): </p>

<ol><li>Novak Djokovic</li>
<li>Roger Federer</li>
<li>Andy Murray</li>
<li>Kei Nishikori</li>
<li>Stan Wawrinka</li></ol>

<p>Personally I'm a big fan of Federer, and hopefully he can win another grand slam. If you're interested, you can probably stream some of the matches from <a href="http://espn3.com">ESPN3</a>.</p>

<a name = football></a>
<p>The regular season of football is also starting, and that means fantasy football is starting up as well. I'm pretty happy with my team so far, but hopefully they live up to my expectations. These are who I'm starting this weekend: </p>

<ul><li>Matt Ryan</li>
<li>Frank Gore</li>
<li>Eddie Lacy</li>
<li>Calvin Johnson</li>
<li>Julio Jones</li>
<li>Delanie Walker</li>
<li>Randall Cobb</li>
<li>Stephen Gostkowski</li>
<li>Panthers Def</li></ul>

<p>Unfortunately I'll probably be busy with schoolwork so I won't be able to watch the a lot of the games. This year, my schedule looks like this (at least for 1st semester): </p>

<table border="1"><tr><td>Blue Days</td><td>Red Days</td></tr>
<tr><td>AP Lang</td><td>Geosystems</td></tr>
<tr><td>AP Gov</td><td>Mobile</td></tr>
<tr><td>Comp Sys</td><td>Web</td></tr>
<tr><td>Parallel</td><td></td></tr></table>

<p>Anyway, that is all for my first webpage.</p>
